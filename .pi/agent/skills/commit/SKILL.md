# Commit

## When to use

- The current work is ready to record in git
- The diff is understood and intentionally scoped

## Process

1. Inspect `git status`, `git diff`, and `git diff --cached`.
2. Read recent commit messages so the new commit fits the repo.
3. If there is nothing worth committing, stop.
4. Stage only the intended files.
   Never stage secrets.
5. Use the user's message if provided.
   Otherwise write a Conventional Commit message:
   - Format: `type(scope): subject`
   - Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`
   - Keep the subject short, specific, and in imperative mood
   - Use the body for why the change exists, important context, and migrations or follow-up work
   - Good examples: `feat(auth): add GitHub OAuth login`, `fix(api): handle empty embedding results`
6. Create the commit and report the hash and message.

## Verification

- The staged changes match the intended scope
- The commit exists
- `git status` confirms the expected result

## Rules

- If the change breaks a contract or requires migration, note it clearly in the commit message body.
- If there is nothing to commit or the diff is not understood, stop.
- Prefer staging specific files over broad adds.
- Do not commit `.env`, credentials, or keys.
- The subject should say what changed.
  The body should explain why.
