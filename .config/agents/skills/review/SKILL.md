# Review

## When to use

- Reviewing current changes before commit or merge
- Reviewing a specific file or focus area
- Checking whether a change is safe to ship

## Process

1. Choose the target from `$ARGUMENTS`, the working tree, staged changes, or the latest commit.
2. Read the actual changes and any available context that explains intent, such as the spec, plan,
   commit message, or PR title and description.
   If your environment offers an isolated review context, you may use it.
   If not, review directly.
3. Apply any repo-specific concerns from `REVIEW.md` if it exists.
4. Prioritize concrete bugs, regressions, contract breaks, failure-path gaps,
   and unnecessary complexity.
5. Report findings as `Must fix`, `Should fix`, or `Observations`, ordered highest risk first.
   A clean review is a valid outcome.

## Verification

- Every finding is tied to concrete code
- Every finding explains why it matters
- Findings are limited to the changes under review
- Highest-risk findings come first
- Pre-existing issues are not mixed in
- No finding is just a style preference

## Rules

- Prioritize real bugs and regressions over style commentary.
- Flag changes that add unnecessary surface area.
- Flag silent contract changes.
- Flag missing or weak failure-path handling when it matters.
- Flag reviewer-facing context that is missing or misleading
  when it would make the change hard to review,
  such as a PR title or description that does not explain what changed and why.
- If there is no concrete diff, file, or commit to review, say so.
- Findings only.
  Do not fix the code.
- Be direct and specific.
- Tie each finding to evidence in the diff.
- Do not speculate without evidence.
- If you are unsure a problem is real, say so honestly.
