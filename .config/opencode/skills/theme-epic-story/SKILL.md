# Theme, Epic, Story - Hierarchical Product Work Structure

A framework for organizing product work at multiple levels of granularity.
This hierarchy helps teams plan strategically while maintaining clear,
actionable work items that can be completed within sprints.

## When to Use This Skill

- Organizing product backlogs
- Planning releases and roadmaps
- Breaking down large initiatives
- Communicating with stakeholders at different levels
- Estimating effort for large features
- Prioritizing work across teams

```

## Theme

### Definition

```text
THEME = Strategic Goal or Focus Area

Characteristics:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  • Broad business or user objective              │
│  • Spans multiple epics and stories              │
│  • Aligns with company vision/strategy           │
│  • May take quarters to fully address            │
│  • Guides prioritization decisions               │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Examples:
├── "Improve Mobile Experience"
├── "Increase User Retention"
├── "Expand to Enterprise Market"
├── "Reduce Customer Support Load"
└── "Enable Self-Service"
```

### Theme Structure

| Component     | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Name          | Clear, memorable identifier         |
| Objective     | What success looks like             |
| Key Results   | Measurable outcomes                 |
| Related Epics | Work that contributes to this theme |
| Owner         | Strategic accountable person        |

## Epic

### Definition

```text
EPIC = Large Feature or Initiative

Characteristics:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  • Too large for single sprint                   │
│  • Delivers significant user value               │
│  • Contains multiple related stories             │
│  • Can be released incrementally                 │
│  • Has clear start and end                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Examples:
├── "User Authentication System"
├── "Document Management Module"
├── "Payment Processing Integration"
├── "Search and Discovery Feature"
└── "Onboarding Flow Redesign"
```

### Epic Structure

```text
Epic Template:

EPIC: [Name]
├── Theme: [Parent theme]
├── Objective: [What this epic achieves]
├── Success Metrics: [How we measure completion]
├── Stories:
│   ├── Story 1
│   ├── Story 2
│   └── Story 3...
├── Dependencies: [Other epics/external factors]
├── Estimated Duration: [Sprints/weeks]
└── Owner: [Product owner or lead]
```

## Story (User Story)

### Definition

```text
STORY = Smallest Unit of User Value

Characteristics:
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  • Completable within single sprint              │
│  • Delivers tangible user value                  │
│  • Written from user's perspective               │
│  • Testable with clear acceptance criteria       │
│  • Independent enough to be prioritized          │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"

Examples:
├── "As a user, I want to reset my password via email
│    so that I can regain access to my account"
├── "As an admin, I want to view user activity logs
│    so that I can audit system usage"
└── "As a customer, I want to save my cart
     so that I can complete purchase later"
```

### Story Structure (INVEST Criteria)

| Criterion       | Meaning                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **I**ndependent | Can be worked on separately from other stories |
| **N**egotiable  | Open to discussion on implementation           |
| **V**aluable    | Delivers value to user or business             |
| **E**stimable   | Team can estimate effort required              |
| **S**mall       | Fits within single sprint                      |
| **T**estable    | Has clear acceptance criteria                  |

## Hierarchy Example

```text
THEME: Document Management
│
│  "Enable users to efficiently manage and
│   collaborate on documents within our platform"
│
├── EPIC: Document Storage System
│   │
│   │  "Users can upload, organize, and
│   │   retrieve documents securely"
│   │
│   ├── STORY: Design database schema for documents
│   │   └── AC: Schema supports metadata, versioning, permissions
│   │
│   ├── STORY: Implement file upload functionality
│   │   └── AC: Users can upload files up to 100MB
│   │
│   ├── STORY: Create folder organization UI
│   │   └── AC: Users can create, rename, delete folders
│   │
│   └── STORY: Add document search capability
│       └── AC: Users can search by name, content, date
│
├── EPIC: Document Sharing

## Breaking Down Work

### Theme → Epics

```text
Decomposition Questions:

Theme: "Improve Mobile Experience"
       │
       ▼
Ask: What major initiatives contribute to this?

Epics:
├── "Responsive Design Overhaul"
├── "Mobile-Specific Features"
├── "Performance Optimization for Mobile"
├── "Touch Gesture Implementation"
└── "Offline Mode Support"
```

### Epic → Stories

```text
Decomposition Techniques:

1. BY WORKFLOW STEPS
   Epic: User Registration
   └── Stories: Enter details → Verify email → Set preferences → Complete

2. BY USER ROLES
   Epic: Admin Dashboard
   └── Stories: Super admin view → Manager view → Standard admin view

3. BY DATA TYPES
   Epic: Import Functionality
   └── Stories: CSV import → JSON import → Excel import

4. BY OPERATIONS (CRUD)
   Epic: Contact Management
   └── Stories: Create contact → Read/list → Update → Delete

5. BY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
   Epic: Search Feature
   └── Stories: Basic search → Filters → Sort → Save searches
```

## Estimation Guidance

```text
SIZE REFERENCE

Theme:
├── Duration: Quarters to year
├── Team effort: Multiple teams possible
└── Story count: 50-200+ stories

Epic:
├── Duration: 2-8 weeks typically
├── Team effort: 1-2 teams
├── Story count: 5-20 stories
└── Story points: 40-150 points

Story:
├── Duration: 1-5 days
├── Team effort: 1-3 developers
├── Story points: 1-13 points (Fibonacci)
└── If > 13 points → Break down further
```

| Product Leaders  | Epics        | Roadmap, dependencies, timelines  |
| Development Team | Stories      | Acceptance criteria, tech details |
| Customers        | Themes/Epics | Benefits, release timelines       |

## Common Pitfalls

```text
ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

❌ Epics that never end
   → Set clear scope and acceptance criteria

❌ Stories too large
   → If can't complete in sprint, break down

❌ Themes too vague
   → Must have measurable outcomes

❌ Skipping hierarchy levels
   → Theme → Story directly loses context

❌ Over-decomposition
   → Stories like "add button" lack value context

❌ Rigid structure
   → Allow refinement as learning happens
```

## Integration with Other Methods

| Method                      | Combined Use                            |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **User Story Fundamentals** | Story writing format and criteria       |
| **Kanban**                  | Visualizing work flow across levels     |
| **Jobs to Be Done**         | Themes aligned with user jobs           |
| **Five Whys**               | Understanding why theme matters         |
