# Hooked Model - Building Habit-Forming Products

The Hooked Model is a four-phase framework by Nir Eyal for creating products that form user habits.
A habit is formed when users engage with a product repeatedly without conscious thought,
driven by internal triggers rather than external marketing.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing user engagement loops
- Improving product retention metrics
- Planning notification and re-engagement strategies
- Building features that create lasting habits
- Evaluating competitor engagement mechanisms
- Auditing ethical implications of engagement design

## Core Concepts

### The Hook Cycle

    +-----------------+
    |                 |
    v                 |
 TRIGGER             |
 (Internal/External) |
    |                 |
    v                 |
 ACTION              |
 (Simple behavior)   |
    |                 |
    v                 |
 VARIABLE REWARD     |
 (Unpredictable)     |
    |                 |
    v                 |

```

### Phase 1: Trigger

**External Triggers** (initial hooks):

- Push notifications
- Email reminders
- Advertising
- Word of mouth
- Social media mentions

**Internal Triggers** (goal state):

- Boredom → Open TikTok
- Loneliness → Check Instagram
- Uncertainty → Google it
- FOMO → Check Slack

### Phase 2: Action

The simplest behavior in anticipation of reward.

**Fogg Behavior Model alignment:**

```text
B = MAT (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger)

For habit formation:
- Motivation: Must exist (desire for reward)
- Ability: Must be HIGH (action must be easy)
- Trigger: Must be present
```

| Product   | Trigger  | Simplest Action |
| --------- | -------- | --------------- |
| Twitter   | Boredom  | Scroll feed     |
| Google    | Question | Type query      |
| Instagram | FOMO     | Open app        |
| Slack     | Anxiety  | Check messages  |

### Phase 3: Variable Reward

Three types of variable rewards:

| Type      | Description          | Example                             |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Tribe** | Social validation    | Likes, comments, follows            |
| **Hunt**  | Material resources   | Search results, deals, information  |
| **Self**  | Personal achievement | Completing tasks, mastery, progress |

**Why "Variable"?**
Predictable rewards lose power.
Slot machines use variable rewards - you never know which pull wins.
Social feeds use the same psychology.

### Phase 4: Investment

User puts something into the product that:

1. Improves the product for them
2. Increases likelihood of return
3. Creates switching costs

| Investment Type | Example              | Lock-in Effect           |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Data            | Preferences, history | Personalization improves |
| Content         | Posts, uploads       | Social capital           |
| Followers       | Audience built       | Network effects          |
| Learning        | Skills developed     | Competency               |
| Reputation      | Reviews, karma       | Identity                 |

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: Map Current Hook

```text
Your Product's Hook:

TRIGGER
External: _____________________
Internal (goal): _______________

ACTION
What's the simplest action? _______________
How many steps/taps? _______________

VARIABLE REWARD
Type: [ ] Tribe  [ ] Hunt  [ ] Self
What's unpredictable? _______________

INVESTMENT
What do users put in? _______________
How does it improve experience? _______________
```

### Step 2: Identify Weak Links

Rate each phase (1-5):

| Phase              | Score | Improvement Needed |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------ |
| Trigger strength   | [/5]  |                    |
| Action simplicity  | [/5]  |                    |
| Reward variability | [/5]  |                    |
| Investment depth   | [/5]  |                    |

### Step 3: Design Improvements

Focus on the weakest phase first.
A hook is only as strong as its weakest link.

## Output Template

```markdown
## Hook Analysis

**Product:** [Name] **Date:** [Date] **Goal:** [Habit to form]

### Current Hook Cycle

**Trigger:**

- External: [Current external triggers]
- Internal target: [Emotion/situation → product]

**Action:**

- Current: [Steps to engage]
- Friction points: [Obstacles]

**Variable Reward:**

- Type: [Tribe/Hunt/Self]
- Variability source: [What changes]

**Investment:**

- Current: [What users contribute]
- Lock-in created: [Switching cost]

### Weakness Assessment

| Phase      | Score (1-5) | Issue |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----- |
| Trigger    |             |       |
| Action     |             |       |
| Reward     |             |       |
| Investment |             |       |

### Improvement Plan

1. **Trigger improvement:** [Specific change]
2. **Action simplification:** [Reduce steps to X]
3. **Reward enhancement:** [Add variability via]
4. **Investment deepening:** [New investment type]

### Ethical Check

- [ ] We'd be comfortable if usage was public
- [ ] No dark patterns employed
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Instagram

| Phase               | Implementation                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Trigger**         | External: notifications. Internal: boredom, FOMO |
| **Action**          | Open app, scroll (one tap)                       |
| **Variable Reward** | New posts (Hunt), likes/comments (Tribe)         |
| **Investment**      | Followers, posts, profile, DM history            |

### Example 2: Slack

| Phase               | Implementation                                            |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**         | External: @mentions. Internal: anxiety about missing info |
| **Action**          | Check channel (one click)                                 |
| **Variable Reward** | New messages (Hunt), recognition (Tribe)                  |
| **Investment**      | Channel history, integrations, workflows                  |

### Example 3: Duolingo

| Phase               | Implementation                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**         | External: streak reminders. Internal: guilt, achievement |
| **Action**          | Complete one lesson (5 min)                              |
| **Variable Reward** | XP, leaderboard (Self + Tribe)                           |
| **Investment**      | Streak, progress, course completion                      |

## Ethical Considerations

### The Manipulation Test

Ask yourself:

1. **Materially improves life?**
   Does the habit genuinely help users?
2. **User is the customer?** Or are they the product?
3. **Would you use it yourself?**
   And let your children use it?
4. **Transparent?**
   Would users feel manipulated if they knew?

### Ethical Spectrum

```text
Facilitator -------- Entertainer -------- Dealer
(Helps users)       (Neutral)            (Exploits users)

Your product should be a Facilitator
```

## Best Practices

### Do

- Start with internal trigger research (what emotion leads to use?)
- Make first action as simple as possible
- Vary rewards meaningfully, not randomly
- Ensure investments create genuine value
- Test hook cycle with real users

### Avoid

- Relying solely on external triggers (expensive, unsustainable)
- Complex actions that require learning
- Predictable rewards that become boring
- Investments that feel like manipulation
- Ignoring ethical implications
