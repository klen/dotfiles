#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay (in milliseconds) between screen updates. Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS you have to either
#: set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high refresh
#: rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input to be
#: processed, repaint_delay is ignored.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay (in milliseconds) before input from the program running in
#: the terminal is processed. Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.

sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents tearing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing)
#: when scrolling. However, it limits the rendering speed to the
#: refresh rate of your monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high
#: keyboard repeat rate, you may notice some slight input latency. If
#: so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

#: Enable/disable the audio bell. Useful in environments that require
#: silence.

# visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

# bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

# command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

#: }}}

#: Color scheme {{{

# include themes/vscode.conf
include themes/pastel.conf

#: The foreground and background colors

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this setting when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile or scale the background image.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
#: it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
#: background color for each window. This setting applies only if
#: background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
#: background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000

#: The foreground for text selected with the mouse. A value of none
#: means to leave the color unchanged.

# selection_background #fffacd

#: The background for text selected with the mouse.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

# mark1_foreground black

#: Color for marks of type 1

# mark1_background #98d3cb

#: Color for marks of type 1 (light steel blue)

# mark2_foreground black

#: Color for marks of type 2

# mark2_background #f2dcd3

#: Color for marks of type 1 (beige)

# mark3_foreground black

#: Color for marks of type 3

# mark3_background #f274bc

#: Color for marks of type 3 (violet)

#: Advanced {{{

# shell .

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files.

# editor .

#: The terminal editor (such as ``vim`` or ``nano``) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell (``$SHELL -l -i -c env``) to see if your
#: shell config files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (``vim``, ``emacs``,
#: etc) and take the first one that exists on your system.

# close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (shell) exits. If no (the
#: default), the terminal will remain open when the child exits as
#: long as there are still processes outputting to the terminal (for
#: example disowned or backgrounded processes). If yes, the window
#: will close as soon as the child process exits. Note that setting it
#: to yes means that any background processes still using the terminal
#: can fail silently because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# allow_remote_control no

#: Allow other programs to control kitty. If you turn this on other
#: programs can control all aspects of kitty, including sending text
#: to kitty windows, opening new windows, closing windows, reading the
#: content of windows, etc.  Note that this even works over ssh
#: connections. You can chose to either allow any program running
#: within kitty to control it, with yes or only programs that connect
#: to the socket specified with the kitty --listen-on command line
#: option, if you use the value socket-only. The latter is useful if
#: you want to prevent programs running on a remote computer over ssh
#: from controlling kitty. Reloading the config will not affect this
#: setting.

# listen_on none

#: Tell kitty to listen to the specified unix/tcp socket for remote
#: control connections. Note that this will apply to all kitty
#: instances. It can be overridden by the kitty --listen-on command
#: line flag. This option accepts only UNIX sockets, such as
#: unix:${TEMP}/mykitty or (on Linux) unix:@mykitty. Environment
#: variables are expanded. If {kitty_pid} is present then it is
#: replaced by the PID of the kitty process, otherwise the PID of the
#: kitty process is appended to the value, with a hyphen. This option
#: is ignored unless you also set allow_remote_control to enable
#: remote control. See the help for kitty --listen-on for more
#: details. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# env 

#: Specify environment variables to set in all child processes. Note
#: that environment variables are expanded recursively, so if you
#: use::

#:     env MYVAR1=a
#:     env MYVAR2=${MYVAR1}/${HOME}/b

#: The value of MYVAR2 will be a/<path to home directory>/b.

# update_check_interval 24

#: Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
#: is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
#: available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
#: to disable. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# startup_session none

#: Path to a session file to use for all kitty instances. Can be
#: overridden by using the kitty --session command line option for
#: individual instances. See
#: https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/overview/#startup-sessions in the
#: kitty documentation for details. Note that relative paths are
#: interpreted with respect to the kitty config directory. Environment
#: variables in the path are expanded. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: set of possible actions is: write-clipboard read-clipboard write-
#: primary read-primary. The default is to allow writing to the
#: clipboard and primary selection. Note that enabling the read
#: functionality is a security risk as it means that any program, even
#: one running on a remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See
#: also  clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 64

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_control. A value of zero means no size limit is applied.

# allow_hyperlinks yes

#: Process hyperlink (OSC 8) escape sequences. If disabled OSC 8
#: escape sequences are ignored. Otherwise they become clickable
#: links, that you can click by holding down ctrl+shift and clicking
#: with the mouse. The special value of ``ask`` means that kitty will
#: ask before opening the link.

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.
