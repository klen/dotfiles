## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork this repository, review the code, and remove things you don’t want or need. Don’t blindly use my settings unless you know what that entails. Use at your own risk!

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/projects/dotfiles`).

git clone https://github.com/klen/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && make

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then `make`
